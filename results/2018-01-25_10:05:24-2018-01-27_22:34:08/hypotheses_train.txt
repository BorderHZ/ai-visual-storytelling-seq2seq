i walked around the park yesterday to get lost .
the top of the tree is taken .
and , a beautiful piece of tree is used to walk under it .
and its magnificent trunk , larger than life itself .
one last picture of its beauty so we could capture it forever .
we went to see the largest tree in the country .
there was a sign that <UNK> us to see if we could find the bank .
the roots were huge and spread out over the ground .
the trunk was really wide , as much as 12 feet !
the wooden beams were shot like two feet <UNK> on it .

we were lucky to find a nice spot on the grass to watch the show .
